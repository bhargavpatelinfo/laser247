        <h2>How Laser 247 platform works and how many games are available to play</h2>
        <p>Fantasy cricket, football, basketball, kabaddi, hockey, volleyball, handball, and baseball are some of the sports that may be played on Laser 247 platform for fantasy gaming, which also includes other sports. It is a simulation game played online, in which participants construct a “virtual team” consisting of actual athletes and compete for points based on how well their “real team” does in actual competitions. The top spot on the leaderboard is reserved for the person who finishes each contest they participate in with the highest possible point total. There are both free and paid contests available on Laser 247. A user is required to pay a set cost in order to participate in a contest, but they stand the chance of winning actual cash. A user must be at least 18 years old and have their profile validated using their PAN in order to take part in a Laser 247 game. Users must also upload a photo of themselves.</p>
